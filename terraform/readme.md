# Terraform

## Overview

In the terraform directory a credentials file needs to be created: `credentials.tf`

Contents of credentials file:

```
do_api_token = "api_token_here"
```

In order to run the terraform, in the folder first issue the command `terraform init`. Next, you can use different `terraform` flags such as `terraform plan/validate/apply/destroy`.
