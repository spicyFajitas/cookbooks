## Paper

"Paper is a fork of Spigot, meaning it builds upon Spigot's code and adds its own features and optimizations. Essentially, Paper is an enhanced version of Spigot, designed for better performance and stability, especially on servers with a higher player count. Spigot, on the other hand, is the standard, more established Minecraft server software." ~ Google AI overview
